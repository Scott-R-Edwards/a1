                    I would class my skills as rudimentary at best but look forward to expanding on them.
                    I was lucky to get a team for my bits course that was very skilled and knolegable tho most of the time I felt lost with my current skill level during the project it gave me a good insight into what you cant do with web development</td>

                    I have only just begone both this year and have a lot to learn.
