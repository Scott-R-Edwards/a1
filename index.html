                <td>The only web development experience I have had so     far is from the course bits.
                    I would class my skills as rudimentary at best but look forward to expanding on them.
                    I was lucky to get a very skilled and knowledgeable team for my bits course.
                    Most of the time I felt lost with my current skill level during the bits project but it did give me a good insight into what you can do in web development.</td>

                <th>Do you see yourself as a programmer or designer, or both?</th>
                <td>I see myself as both in the most amateurish           sense.
                    I have only just begun both this year and still have a lot to learn.
                    That said I feel I have a good grasp of the basics</td>

                <td>I was brought to this course by the natural progression of my degree but it has been a course I've been looking forward to since exposure to web development in Bits.  </td>

                <th>What are you hoping to get out of the course?</th>
                <td>I am looking to learn more about the actual building of the website other than just the coding of the website as in how every thing is stored on the sever side. </td>

              <tr>
                <th>Assignments allow for individual or paried work. What strengths do you have and what strengths would you like your assignment partner to have?</th>
                <td>I would be open to working with a partner if approached.
                    My strengths are that I am creative and have had a little previous experience in web development.
                    I would welcome a new or experienced partner someone to learn from or someone to learn with either suits me fine.
                    What I will not accept is someone looking for a free ride if you're not proactive and willing to put in the work then I am defiantly not the person you are looking for.
                    My other stipulation is someone who only points out problems if you don't like something always feel free to bring it up but at least offer up an alternative. </td>

                    Mobile websites I access are again streaming and news as well as few sites that are like interesting things in the world of science and such.</td>

                <th>Do you have any interests or hobbies?</th>
                <td>My hobbies all very nerdy I love gaming in all its form be it pc gaming or on the table top still, love a good board game.
I also enjoy painting miniatures.
Of course, pcs are also something I love tinkering with hardware side or software.
At the moment my main hobbies would be streaming on Twitch.  </td>
